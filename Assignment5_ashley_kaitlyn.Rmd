### Introduction

When considering take of natural resources, it is important to consider the effects this take can have on its associated ecosystem. Studies have shown that clear cutting for logging operations can have both positive and negative impacts on the habitat and the species that live there, and these impacts can change with time (Murphy 1981).  The HJ Andrews Experimental Forest is a long term ecological research (lter) site located in Oregon that has two sections of forest, a clear cut section (ca. 1963) and a 500 year old coniferous forest, that allows researchers to explore this question over space and time. Here we look at the Pacific giant salamander (*Dicamptodon tenebrosus*) (Figure 1.), an inhabitant of this area, and a species whose larval stage was shown to be negatively affected by logging (Corn 1989).  Using the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest lter survey data, we investigate if there is a relationship to the type of forest (clear cut or old growth) the Pacific giant salamanders reside in, to their abundance, weight and channel preference.

### Data and Methods

Data on Pacific giant salamanders was collected from 1993 - 2017 in Mack Creek of H.J Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon (Figure 2.). Samples were collected in forests that were subjected to clearcutting in 1963 (clear cut) or in a 500 year old coniferous forest (old growth). Salamanders were collected via electrofishing in different channels (pools, cascades, or side - channels) and weighed to the nearest 0.01 grams. For more detailed information, refer to the [metadata](https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-and.4027.12) (Gregory S. V. 2016). We compared salamander abundances in 2017 between channel types in clear cut and growth forests using a chi-squared test. Mean salamander weights between clear cut and old growth forests were compared with a Welch two-sample t-test (Î± = 0.05). In addition, we used an ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD to compare mean salamander weights between channel types. All analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1.

### Results

#### A: Changes in annual salamander abundance in old growth and clear cut sections of Mack Creek.
Abundance in pacific salamanders has increased overall in both clear cut and old growth forests from 1993 to 2017, rising by 198% and 154% respectively. The two salamander populations appear to follow a similar pattern of incline and decline in population abundance throughout the study. The salamanders in old growth forests generally had higher counts compared to those in clear cut forests, until 2014 (Figure 3.).

```{r, fig.cap= "***Figure 3.*** *Annual pacific salamander counts in old growth and clear cut sections of Mack Creek (1993 - 2017).*"}

#### B: Abundance of Pacific giant salamanders across channel and forest type in 2017


```{r, include = FALSE}

#Here we explore the abundances of salamanders per channel type and forest type. 

# ps is for pacific salamander. creates dataframe with only information for 2017 salamanders
ps_2017_channel_count <- pacific_salamander %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>% 
  count(channel_type, forest_type, name = "count") %>% 
  na.omit()

# create table with counts
ps_2017_channel_table <- ps_2017_channel_count %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = channel_type, values_from = count) 

# create a table with counts and proportions of salamanders found in each channel type of the total amount found in each forest type
ps_2017_channel_props <- ps_2017_channel_table %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>% #percentages go to one decimal point
  adorn_ns(position = "front") %>% #add the n value before the percent
  kable(col.names = c("Forest type", "Cascade", "Pool", "Side-channel"),
        caption = "***Table 1.*** *Counts of pacific salamanders in clear cut and old growth forests across channel types in 2017. Percentages of salamanders found in each channel type (cascade, pool, side-channel) are expressed in relation to the total number of salamanders found in each forest type (clear cut, old growth).*") %>% #rename the channel types
  kable_styling() %>% 
  add_header_above(c("Channel type " = 4))

ps_2017_channel_props
```


```{r, include = FALSE}
# Make this a contingency table that **only contains the actual counts** to perform chi sqaure

chi_ps_2017_channel_count <- ps_2017_channel_table %>% 
  select(-forest_type)

chi_ps_2017_channel_count

chi_test_ps_2017_channel <- chisq.test(chi_ps_2017_channel_count)
chi_test_ps_2017_channel

```

There is no significant effect of forest type (clear cut/old growth) on where in the channel (cascade/pool/side-channel) pacific salamanders are found ($\chi$^2^(`r chi_test_ps_2017_channel$parameter`) = `r round(chi_test_ps_2017_channel$statistic,2)`, *p* = `r round(chi_test_ps_2017_channel$p.value, 2)`). The percentage of salamanders found in cascades and side-channels differed by less than 5% between clear cut and old growth forests. Percentages of salamanders found in pools differed slightly more, but still by less than 10%. (*Table 1.*)

#### C: Mean weights of Pacific giant salamanders between forest types in 2017

```{r, include = FALSE}

# Creates a dataframe with only 2017 salamander data with forest type, channel type, and weights
ps_2017_weight <- pacific_salamander %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>% 
  select(year, forest_type, channel_type, weight)

#exploratory data viz

ggplot(ps_2017_weight, aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = forest_type))

#even though we see outliers and the distribution are not normal, bc we have such high sample sizes we can use the central limit theorem


```

```{r, include = FALSE}
#we would like compare mean salamander weight in 2017 in clear cut and old growth forests. we first create data fromes for weights in each forest in 2017 only. 

#clear cut 2017 weights dataframe
cc_weight <- ps_2017_weight %>% 
  filter(forest_type == "Clear cut")

#old growth 2017 weights data frame
og_weight <- ps_2017_weight %>% 
  filter(forest_type == "Old growth")

#running a t-test and effect size to statisically evaluate the difference in weights
ps_weight_ttest <- t.test(cc_weight$weight, og_weight$weight)
ps_weight_ttest
# t = 1.6669, df = 692.79, p-value = 0.09599, mean of x= 7.77, mean of y = 6.58, not a significant difference using a CI of 5%

#effect size
ps_weight_eff <- cohen.d(cc_weight$weight, og_weight$weight, na.rm = TRUE)
ps_weight_eff
#effect size is negligible

# there is not a sig diff between mean salamnder weights in 2017 between clear cut and old growth 

```
Weights were compared of pacific giant salamanders in old growth forests to those in clear cut forests in 2017 only. There was not a significant difference in weights of salamanders between the two forest types (Welch Two Sample t-test, t = `r round(ps_weight_ttest$statistic,2)`, df = `r round(ps_weight_ttest$parameter,2)`, p = `r round (ps_weight_ttest$p.value,3)`). Mean weights differed by 16.7%, with a negligible effect size (Cohen's d = (`r round(ps_weight_eff$estimate,2)`)).

A significant difference was detected in mean salamander weights (g) by channel type (one-way ANOVA, F(`r ps_aov_outputs[1]`, `r ps_aov_outputs[2]`) = `r round(ps_aov_outputs[7],2)`, *p* = `r round(ps_aov_outputs[9],3)`). A post-hoc analysis was performed using Tukey's HSD and a signifiant difference was detected  between side-channel and pool (*p* = `r round(ps_tukey$channel_type[3,4],3)`), differing by around 48% with a small effect size (Cohen's d = (`r round(pool_side_channel_ef$estimate,2)`)). There was not a significant difference detected between the other pairwise combinations.

While comparisons of means was used for analysis, it is important to note that this might not be the best method for analysis, as a visual investigation indicates that the data contains many outliers and is heavily skewed (Figure 4.). For further investigation, it might be a better option to make comparisons using median values, a measure of central tendency that will not be biased by skew and outliers. 

<br>

#### Summary 
- From 1993 - 2017, Pacific giant salamander abundances between clear cut and old growth forests followed similar trends, but overall were less in clear cut forests. (Figure 3.)

- Abundances of salamanders in cascades, pools, and side - channels were not significantly effected by the forest type they were found in (clear cut or old growth). (Table 1.)

- Average salamander weights did not significantly differ between forest types.(Results C.)

- Average salamander weights differed significantly between side-channels and pools.(Figure 4.)
